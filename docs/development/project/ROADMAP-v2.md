# 🚀 ROADMAP v2.0 - Complete Architecture Rewrite

## 📍 Current State: v1.1.1.9.2.4.2.1 → v2.0.0

### **Decision: Clean Architecture Break**
After reaching v1.1.1.9.2.4.2.1, we've decided to rebuild with enterprise architecture rather than continue incremental improvements.

## 🎯 Why v2.0?

### **Current v1.x Limitations:**
- ✅ Core generator works well (`init.sh`)
- ✅ Wizard UI is good
- ✅ ConfigGenerator logic is solid
- ❌ No authentication/multi-tenancy
- ❌ Monolithic backend (1100+ lines single file)
- ❌ Deployment automation incomplete
- ❌ No proper job queue
- ❌ SQLite not suitable for production

### **v2.0 Goals:**
- 🏗️ **Enterprise architecture** (NestJS + Next.js)
- 🔐 **Multi-tenant SaaS** with authentication
- 🚀 **Scalable deployment** with job queues
- 📊 **Production ready** with monitoring
- 🐳 **Docker → Kubernetes** path
